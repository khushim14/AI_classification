# AI_classification
 

# Overview 
This repository contains the implementation of an **AI-based image classification and segmentation** model using **U-Net architecture**. The project leverages deep learning techniques to classify and segment images efficiently, making it ideal for applications such as medical imaging, object detection, and satellite image analysis.  

# Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to develop a **robust AI model** capable of accurately segmenting objects in images. We implement and train a **U-Net model** for pixel-wise classification, ensuring high precision in object boundary detection.  

# Key Features
